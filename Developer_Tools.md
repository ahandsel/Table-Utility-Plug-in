### Using plugin-packer & plugin-uploader Together

Open 2x terminals and follow the below examples.

```console
# Change to the directory containing the Plug-in file
$ cd 1_Starting_Point
```

#### Terminal 1
Run plugin-packer with watch option.  
A plugin.zip file is created to monitor changes to the `src` directory.

```console
$ kintone-plugin-packer --watch src
```

#### Terminal 2
Run plugin-uploader with watch option.  
The Plug-in file is uploaded to monitor changes to the `src` directory

```console
$ kintone-plugin-uploader --watch plugin.zip
```

Once the above set up is complete, modifications to the Plug-in's source code will automatically be zipped & uploaded to Kintone. Changes are visible with a simple page refresh.
